## FAQ

### Who's this for?
Well, it's for anyone who wants to know a little SQL.

### What do I need to know to get started?
You should have a bit of programming knowledge and not be afraid of the
command line.

### I'm afraid of the command line. What now?
A good resource for the command line is Michael Hartl's [Learn Enough Command Line to be
Dangerous] (https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial).

### Will I be a SQL ninja/rockstar/god after this?
No.

### Will I be a SQL expert after this?
No.

### Will I be a SQL mid-level after this?
Probably not.

### Will I be a SQL novice after this?
Probably.

### But you're a SQL ninja/rockstar/god, right?
LOL!

### OK, but a SQL expert?
Nope.

### SQL mid-level (and I'm getting disappointed in you here)
Maybe?

### Fine, so what makes you qualified to write this?
A keyboard mostly. OK ... and a desire to possibly help people with
something that might have helped me a bit when I was trying to learn
SQL.

### Do you like beer or what?
I have one a month whether I need it or not.

### Why'd you choose beer for this then?
It had the variety I was looking for to generate some reasonable but not
too large data sets.

### What are the `.rb` files in here?
Those are ruby files I used to generate the data for the database. You
don't really need them, but they're there if you want to look at them.

### The ruby code's not very good in some places.
No, no it's not.

### So, I should just cut/paste this into the SQL console?
No, please don't do that. You'll learn far more by typing in everything
yourself. After you've typed it in, try different things.

### Umm ... that beer list is pretty long, you really want me to type that in?
Nah ... I'd cut/paste that one. But, do make sure you know what it's
doing.

### Anything else I should know?
Nope, just go hack some code now.
